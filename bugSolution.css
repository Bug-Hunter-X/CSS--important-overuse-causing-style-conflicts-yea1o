The solution lies in avoiding `!important` and instead using more specific selectors or the CSS cascade to control styles. For example, if we have a more specific style, this style will take precedence.

```css
.container .my-element {
  color: blue;
}

.my-element {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case the blue color will be applied to `.my-element` when it is a child of the container element, as it is more specific than the other selector.  This approach helps achieve the intended style without relying on `!important`, which contributes to a cleaner and more maintainable CSS structure.
